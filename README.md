# FIR-filter-designer

A simple python GUI tool using Tkinker and Matplotlib you can use to create FIR filter parameters of types low-pass, high-pass, band-pass and band-stop after selecting a window function and plot frequency/impulse responses then print out the normalised parameters to the console. 

Many practicle applications store filter parameters as intergers rather than normalised floats so you can use this GUI program to convert from floating point parameters to an interger of given precision and see how (espcially small) interger parameters decrease precision at a cost of being more practical to implement.
